### Hobby Projects
I've been using Forge - https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/ to work on a mod for Minecraft. It's my longest project so far and the one I'm most proud of. For a more general description of the mod, visit https://isaacmartin151.github.io/HunterXHunter/. Estimated launch time for version 1 of the mod will be December 2021

### Languages used

Ranked from most comfortable to least comfortable, the various languages and frameworks I've interacted with 

```markdown
1. Java - The language I've been using for all of my Mod, which encompasses the majority of my programming time for the past few years
2. C/C++ - The language used in most of my classes, have a good knowledge blend of practical and theoretical information in C++
      - Java and C/C++ are the only languages I would consider myself comfortable with for a technical assessment
3. Python - Used in my senior project, for some quick and easy scripts, and a simple discord bot
4. Javascript - Used in my Web development and Web application classes
      - The Software Tools/Frameworks below I would classify myself as having brief/passing interactions with, but I have used
Maven, Haskell, PostMan
```

[FFMpeg Video/Audio managing](https://ffmpeg.org/)

I drew heavily from [Vazkii Botania](https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania) in my mod-learning process, and the capabilities/shaders are nearly identical to Vazkii's

[Forge Modding Support](https://forums.minecraftforge.net/forum/70-modder-support/) for supplying answers to the questions I should be asking rather than the ones I asked

[TheGreyGhost](https://github.com/TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample), super helpful repository for learning modding concepts

[TurtyWurty's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCicAXLV4w2X6bn2EuM4To4w) and [TechnoVision's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3n-lKS-MYlunVtErgzSFZg)
